Course Description
------------------
Speech 102 explores the fundamentals of conceptulaizing, organizing, preparing, rehearsing, and delivering speeches in a variety of public forums.

Course Design
-------------
SPCH 102 is a skills-building course and allows students repeated opportunities to work through the speech process. The assignment-based design engages Blooms Taxonomy from comprehension to creation a minimum of five times. Reading, discussion, and quizzes occur throughout the course to enhance memory and understanding of core concepts. Peer coaching and/or review, as well as post-presentation journaling enhance analysis and evaluation.

For an online version, students should speak to a live audience in a public setting for the informative and persuasive assignments. Live audiences may be created from the class, from authentic situations, or from adult acquaintances. Live presentations may take place over a synchronous platform (like Zoom) or may be captured via video in a non-virtual space. The audience should consist of no less than five adults and/or peers. 

If space is classroom space is available, online instructors may explore a hybrid model.

The following series of speech assignments allow students to repeat the process of conceiving, researching, organizing, developing, practicing, and presenting original speeches throughout the course. The short, informative, and persuasive sequence is recommended. The group presentation may be sequenced at the discretion of the instructor (after practice/short presentations are completed).

1. **Two short presentations** to orient students to the process (2-4 minutes).
2. **Informative presentation** to develop research and analysis skills (self, audience, and topic), as well as increase organizational skills (5-7 minutes).
3. **Persuasive presentation** to explore the fundamentals of argumentation, further develop organizational skills, effectively engage rhetorical devices, and enhance content evaluation in relation to an audience (6-8 minutes).
4. **Small group presentations** add group problem-solving and communication to the speech process. The assignment should have a presentation outcome or element requiring a coordinated effort. The presentation does not have to be live. For example, groups ma create a kiosk-style presentation to which all group members contribute or a social media campaign to call people to action. 

**Note:** More short presentations (under 5 minutes) may be added wherever instructors find the assignments most useful for their individual curriculum.

Assignment Weights
------------------
* **Short presentations** (Intro, Special Occasion, Impromptu, etc.) should equal 10% of semester/term grade.
* **Long Presentations** (Informative, Persuasive, and Group) should equal 50% of semester/term grade.
* **Written Assessments** (Quizzes, Tests, Outlines, etc.) should equal 20-30% of semester/term grade.
* **Participation** (Journals, Peer reviews, Discussions, Attendance, etc.) should equal 10-20% of semester/term grade.

Assignment weights should add to 100%.

Grading
-------
Normed rubrics for informative and persuasive assignments are available in the assignment library. Using the rubric to determine grades maintains consistency across sections of DWR courses. Please use normed categories and criteria to enhance assessment outcomes. If you wish to add categories or criteria you may, but please do not remove any. Other rubric assignments are also available in the assignment library but are not normed.

Please share rubrics with students at the beginning of each unit. The goal is to provide grades and feedback to students within one week of presentations.
